# Introduction: This Dockerfile can be used to build a container image that can, in turn, be used
#               to "build" (hence, its name, "builder") the submission schema release artifacts.

# Use Python 3.9 because that's the Python version listed in `pyproject.toml`.
FROM python:3.9

WORKDIR /submission-schema

# Install Poetry, a package manager for Python (an alternative to pip).
RUN pip install poetry

# Set this configuration option so that when Poetry creates a virtual environment, it doesn't
# interfere with a `.venv` folder in a mounted volume.
RUN poetry config virtualenvs.in-project false

# Copy the entire repository into the container image.
#
# Note: Copying _only_ the dependency lists (i.e. `pyproject.toml` and `poetry.lock`) and then
#       mounting the entire repository as a volume in the container image at `docker run` time
#       results in `make all` failing due to the absence of an `nmdc_submission_schema` package.
#       I haven't yet figured out why that happens, but it doesn't happen if I have copied the
#       entire repository into the container image here at build timeâ€”so, I do the latter.
#
ADD . /submission-schema

# Install the project's Python dependencies.
RUN poetry install --no-interaction

# Run the command that builds the submission schema release artifacts.
