The systems identified should have a coarse spatial grain, to provide the general environmental context of where the sampling was done (e.g. were you in the desert or a rainforest?). We recommend using subclasses of ENVO's biome class: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00000428. Format (one term): termLabel [termID], Format (multiple terms): termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]|termLabel [termID]. Example: Annotating a water sample from the photic zone in middle of the Atlantic Ocean, consider: oceanic epipelagic zone biome [ENVO:01000033]. Example: Annotating a sample from the Amazon rainforest consider: tropical moist broadleaf forest biome [ENVO:01000228].
